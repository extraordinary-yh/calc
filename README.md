# Student Databases

## Overview

Welcome to the Student Databases project! This repository is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in both C and Java. It serves as a robust foundation for building high-performance applications that require efficient data manipulation and storage.

## Techinical Features

### Multi-Language Support
- Written in both C and Java, offering flexibility and a wide range of application.

### Data Structures
- **Hash Table**: Efficient key-value storage and retrieval.
- **Linked List**: Dynamic data storage with optimized insertion and deletion.
- **Stack**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure ideal for various applications like parsing expressions.
- **Tree**: Hierarchical data structure useful for sorting and searching operations.

### Algorithms
- **Hashing Algorithms**: For quick data retrieval in hash tables.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: For trees, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### Test Drivers
- Includes driver programs to test and demonstrate the functionality of each data structure.

### Build Automation
- Makefile included for easy compilation and execution of programs.

## Product Features

### Scalability
- Designed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for applications that require handling large datasets efficiently.

### Performance Metrics
- The project includes performance metrics that allow for the evaluation of data structure efficiency, providing valuable insights for product optimization.

### User-Centric Design
- While this is a back-end project, the data structures and algorithms are implemented with the end-user experience in mind, ensuring quick and reliable data retrieval and storage.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
- The multi-language implementation allows for easier collaboration across engineering teams that may be using different programming languages.
